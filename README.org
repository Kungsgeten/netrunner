/netrunner.el/ fetches data from [[https://netrunnerdb.com/][NetrunnerDB.com]], making it easy to create
[[https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/][Android: Netrunner]] decklists in Emacs (like any hacker should). This package
adds a backend for [[http://company-mode.github.io/][Company mode]], adds "card info" links into [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], and
allows searching for cards with [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]].

In an org-mode buffer, run =netrunner-toggle-netrunner-buffer= (or add =# -*-
netrunner-buffer: t; -*-= to the top of the buffer). Now the company backend
should work for completing card names. You could also use =helm-netrunner= to
list cards.

If you to wish to preview card images in Helm, the images has to be
downloaded locally.  The images will be placed in =netrunner-image-dir= (a
directory called =netrunner-images= inside your =user-emacs-directory= by
default). Use =netrunner-download-all-images= to download images.
